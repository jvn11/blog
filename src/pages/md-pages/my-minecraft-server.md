# You saw the title right!

**I created my MC server!**

Now, I know what you are wondering.

<i class="text-muted">What is the port?</i>

Well, before I put the port, I'm gonna give you a warning.

<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-warning text-white"><b>The port is only local, to where I live</b></div>

So basically, it is not gonna be public, just local (aka just avalable where I live)

But anyway, the host & port is `localhost:12346`
