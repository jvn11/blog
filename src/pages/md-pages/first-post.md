# Hi dudes!

I got some news to tell you...

This is my first blog post!

I managed to create (what everyone creates if they need a blog, just leave it there ;D) a dynamic blog built of Markdown Files!

Don't belive me? Go to [https://www.github.com/jvn11/blog](https://www.github.com/jvn11/blog) to see it.

**Woohoo!** _Markdown_ is `fun`!

Cool JS snippet:

```javascript
const isthiscool = true
console.log(`Is MD cool?: ${isthiscool}`)
```

That will output:

```shell
$ node ismdcool.js
Is MD cool? true
```

## **Bye**!!!

Have a great `memorial day`!
